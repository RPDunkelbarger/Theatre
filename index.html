      <h2>The Mousetrap</h2>
      <h5>Classic Murder Mystery by Agatha Christie</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
      <h5>Classic Murder Mystery by Agatha Christie</h5>
      <p>The classic murder mystery The Mousetrap by Agatha Christie opened in London's West End in 1952 and ran continuously until 16 March 2020, when the stage performances had to be discontinued during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>The play has a twist ending, which the audience is traditionally asked not to reveal after leaving the theatre.</p>
      <p>Mr.Paravicini is a man of unknown provenance, who turns up claiming his car has overturned in a snowdrift. He appears to be affecting a foreign accent and artificially aged with make-up.</p>
      <p>Audiences were asked to vote on who they thought the killer was at intermission, they clearly enjoyed Paravachini’s inexplicable behavior and antics, he never won the vote for who the killer might be.</p>
      <p>At the Strollers season announcement, some members were disappointed that there would only be three plays in the season and pointed out that all three playwrights were British. Another member said, why not make it a theme, “The British Invasion.” I was immediately inspired and rushed to get a comp of a poster design to the board the next morning.</p>

      <h2>Pudding</h2>
      <h5>Touching and funny absurdist comedy</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
      <p>A lonely widower tries to find meaning in life by sending boxes of pudding to random strangers in the mail. An ambitious young marketing executive arrives at his door by mistake, fascinated by what he’s doing decides to make him a star.</p>
      <p>Performed in black box Broom Street Theatre
      <p>The black stage and black set pieces of Broom Street Theatre, contrasted by realistic costumes, specific props, and a real door, fed the absurdity of the story and situations. Audience members in the front rows were offered ponchos or plastic to cover themselves if they wanted them. When a giant vat of pudding was rolled onstage near the end of the show, the audience was convinced they were about to be splattered with it (they were not, but that’s show business!)</p>
      <p>The performance was incredibly demanding and exhausting, but playing the character was easy, because he was so much like me. A lot of the lines were reactions to what was going on around him baffled by the absurdity, making them extremely difficult to memorize – but they had to be correct because other cast members cued off of them. Was onstage all but 30 seconds of the show because one costume change had to be done off-stage.</p>
    
      <h2>The Undertow</h2>
      <h5>2nd show by playwright Michael Tooher</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
      <p>The second original work by Portland (Maine) based playwright Michael Tooher after Pudding. Artistic director Heather Renken chose at least three of Tooher’s plays to premier at Broom Street, all three were very successful at the theater.</p>
      <p>Played a troubled psychologist helping a young pop star move past her childhood abuse.</p>
      <p>Dr. Irby was a psychologist returning to practice after the loss of his only daughter. His first new client is a troubled young pop star who is exhibiting extreme and dangerous behaviour. Belligerent, sarcastic, and uncooperative at first he is ultimately able to uncover and help her heal from horrifying childhood abuse.</p>
      <p>It was extremely challenging subject matter and the performances and rehearsals were emotionally intense. My amazingly talented young co-star would occasionally turn to me during rehearsal when the story and work was the most difficult and with their rainbow faux-hawk, smile and wink to assure me they were okay and it was only a play.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Nottingham</h2>
      <h5>Absurdist take on what happened in Nottingham after Robin Hood won</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>
      <p>What happens next, after Robin Hood wins the day? He has to rule, which isn’t as easy or as much fun as leading his band of merry men. Robin Hood now had to face the challenges and work of ruling the land which left little time for “adventure laughs”, and the former administration wasn’t going to make it easy for him.</p>
      <p>The not-so-subtle subtext was a commentary on the political and current events at the time as some became disillusioned that The Obama Administration was not able to magically fix all of the nation's problems overnight. This Broom Street original play did what Broom Street had done since the ‘60s, make us think about social and political issues of the day in a way that the members of Monty Python would approve of.</p>
      <p>Directed to play the classic villain The Sherrif of Nottingham after Tom Hiddleston as Loki, I came up with the underlying “motivation” that he really, really loved his job, and he wanted it back damn it! As the obvious villian and foil, The Sherrif was a distraction from the real “bad guy” revealed at the end to be the Monarchy itself.</p>
