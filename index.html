      <h2 id="mousetrap">The Mousetrap</h2>
      <h5>Classic murder mystery</h5>
      <div class="bodyImage"><img src="images/mousetrap01.jpg" alt="The enigmatic Mr. Paravicini."></div>
      <p>The classic murder mystery The Mousetrap by Agatha Christie opened in London's West End in 1952 and ran continuously until 16 March 2020, when the stage performances had to be discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>Mr.Paravicini is a man of unknown provenance, who turns up claiming his car has overturned in a snowdrift. He appears to be affecting a foreign accent and artificially aged with make-up.</p>
      <p>At intermission audiences were asked to vote on who they thought the killer was. While they clearly enjoyed Paravachini’s inexplicable behavior and antics, he never won the vote for who the killer might be.</p>

      <h2 id="pudding">Pudding</h2>
      <h5>Touching absurd comedy</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="images/pudding01.jpg" alt="The Crazy Pudding Man makes his national television debut."></div>
      <p>A lonely widower tries to find meaning in life by sending boxes of pudding to random strangers in the mail. An ambitious young marketing executive arrives at his door by mistake, fascinated by what he’s doing decides to make him a star.</p>
      <p>The black stage and black set pieces of Broom Street Theatre, contrasted by realistic costumes, specific props, and a real door, fed the absurdity of the story and situations. Audience members in the front rows were offered ponchos or plastic to cover themselves if they wanted them. When a giant vat of pudding was rolled onstage near the end of the show, the audience was convinced they were about to be splattered with it (they were not, but that’s show business!)</p>
      <p>The performance was incredibly demanding and exhausting, but playing the character was easy, because he was so much like me. A lot of the lines were reactions to what was going on around him baffled by the absurdity, making them extremely difficult to memorize – but they had to be correct since other cast members cued off of them. Was onstage all but 30 seconds of the show because one costume change had to be done off-stage.</p>

      <h2 id="undertow">The Undertow</h2>
      <h5>Dark drama about healing and recovery</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="images/undertow01.jpg" alt="Dr. Irby faces his own grief."></div>
      <p>The second original work by Portland (Maine) based playwright Michael Tooher after Pudding. Artistic director Heather Renken chose at least three of Tooher’s plays to premier at Broom Street, all three were very successful for the theater.</p>
      <p>Dr. Irby was a psychologist returning to practice after the loss of his only daughter. His first new client was a troubled young pop star exhibiting extreme and dangerous behaviour. Belligerent, sarcastic, and uncooperative at first he was ultimately able to uncover, and help her heal from, horrifying childhood abuse.</p>
      <p>It was extremely challenging subject matter and the performances and rehearsals were emotionally intense. My amazingly talented young co-star would occasionally turn to me during rehearsal when the story and work was the most difficult, smile and wink to assure me they were okay and it was only a play.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 id="nottingham">Nottingham</h2>
      <h5>Pointed comedic take on current events</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="images/nottingham01.jpg" alt="The Sheriff and Maid Marian in rehearsal."></div>
      <p>What happens next, after Robin Hood wins the day? He has to rule, which isn’t as easy or as much fun as leading his band of merry men. Robin Hood now had to face the challenges and work of ruling the land which left little time for “adventure laughs”, and the former administration wasn’t going to make it easy for him.</p>
      <p>The not-so-subtle subtext was a commentary on the political and current events at the time as some became disillusioned that the Obama Administration was not able to magically fix all of the nation's problems overnight. This Broom Street original play did what Broom Street had done since the 1960s, make us think about social and political issues of the day in a way that the members of Monty Python would approve of.</p>
      <p>Directed to play the classic villain The Sherrif of Nottingham after Tom Hiddleston as Loki, I came up with the underlying “motivation” that he really, really loved his job, and he wanted it back damn it! However, as the obvious villian and foil, The Sherrif was a distraction from the real “bad guy” revealed at the end to be the Monarchy itself.</p>
